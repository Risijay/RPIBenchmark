This code has been slightly modified to stress the pi even more.

# How to run the Benchmark
Its super easy!
copy and paste this code into your terminal:
<br>
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/risijay/rpibenchmark/master/benchmark.sh | sudo bash
<br>
# Information
This program will run 4 tests:
1. CPU test
2. Threads test
3. Memory test
4. HDParm test
# What will happen?
At the end of the test (depending on your cooling solution) your pi will Thermal Throttle.
<br>
(our tests show that the bear pi will throttle after the threads test)
<br>
This test will show how your pi performs and what tasks it can handle
